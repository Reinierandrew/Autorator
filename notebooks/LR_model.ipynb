      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I thought the food was tasty but they used a lot of food coloring which I never like or want and the poor I bread was not completely cooked and was raw and full of oil which I feel is a sloppy mistake. There are a lot of better Indian options for better quality so I'm not sure I will return.\n",

      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... great entreatment, sushi's alright not the best, good prices, but i think the best thing there is there calamari.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We were there for Teppanyaki dinner.\n",
      "It is really fun watching the chef cooking in front of you doing some fire tricks however the food is not that good for the price.\n",
      "So it is just a one time deal. :(\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Disappointed in the food. We got the hibachi scallops. They were rubbery and tasteless. The \"shrimp flambe\" was three tiny, forlorn shrimp with no flavor. Plating was inelegant. Sushi was ok\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... venue has loads of swag. food was delish. wait was long. service was so-so...literally had a salad bowl toss on the table in front of us. rude.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Decent but not really worth the price. Have some quality food and drinks but very expensive and not really worthy of the prices they have.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Per our server, these chefs are artists and will not deviate from the menu. We wanted the apple fritter pancake and asked for it without toppings and were denied. They are toppings... just don't put them on top!!! So we went for the coffee cake and apple fritters. Those did not dissapoint, but we won't be back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food was testy, but portion is small and relatively pricy. We had to sit in the same table with total strangers so not very fan of this place.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Have eaten there three times, and three times I have been underwhelmed or outright disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high going in with all the buzz this place has gotten but damn, I was not impressed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I didn't care for this establishment because the food was just ok and the seating was uncomfortable after a long wait it was picnic table benches. Won't likely return\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Poor service this time. Way understaffed for number of customers. Took over 1/2 hour just to get soup and salad. The soup was cold and had to be sent back. Manager did comp our lunch but the whole lunch experience was ruined.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I found Brio ok but there are only so many things I can try on the menu. (e.g. pizza) For the price, I would rather eat pizza elsewhere and the salad wasn't all the exciting to me either. I might just be down on the place because I have been there a couple times and both times were work lunches. Bad association...work is not tasty.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was good. Nice atmosphere. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was slow. Server was polite and professional, but very busy and rushed so not the best experience. We will give it another try, but will avoid Saturday night.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I paid for delivery service through yelp. Attempted to try lobster and shrimp; shrimp, fettuccine and tomatoes no lobster. Disappointed but not surprised.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The carne asada taco was incredible but tiny, and I wasn't particularly impressed with the quality of the Sonora Hog Dog.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I've been here so many times over the past years, and it was always fabulous. I decided to have a small Christmas party for 10 guests...it was awful! The service was just eh, and the prime rib was not good at all. I took two bites and that was it.\n",
      "What a terrible disappointment this trip was.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was delicious but overpriced.  The service was so-so to terrible, depending on the time of day.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Hummus swimming in tahini\n",
      "Extra peice of pita $2, $14 cocktail maybe 3 inches and no garnish, wrap was flavorless. Outdoor patio is nice.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Overpriced burned coffee :/  staff changed since I last went, and it's just not the same.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was delicious, had the mac &cheese. Not a fan of their beers at all, so can't comment on those. \n",
      "\n",
      "But tonight it was 80 degrees in there based on the thermostat. It was so uncomfortable. \n",
      "\n",

      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... FYI; the menu that is on their website is not current, as evidenced when I tried to order take out and was told that they no longer carry noodle soups.  BUMMER!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Tried this place for the first time. Food was ok. Nothing to shout about. However, the service was horrible. I had to get up and flag the waitress down for a napkin after my food was served. Had to do the same for a drink. Can't see myself going back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The chargrilled oysters are amazing! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is being the service was kind of terrible. My shrimp po boy was awesome, but my sister said her alligator po boy was just okay.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I ordered a Caesar salad with shrimps and the shrimps tasted terrible, just like some cheap frozen ones you might find in bad college dining halls.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... 3 stars only because the oyster chef (the one with dreads) was awesome. Food came out wrong and cold. Highly disappointed with my first dining experience in New Orleans. Dine elsewhere\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good menu selection and good service, but the portion size was less than expected. Not the best restaurant I've been to in NOLA, but not even close to the worst. On the plus side, I had plenty of room for pralines and ice cream somewhere else.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Went with friends none of our food was properly seasoned. Avoid the Alfredo unless you like bland foods. We left disappointed. Also it was awkward for the waiter to stand over us and watch us take out our money for the bill. I'm not sure if he was new but we all felt uncomfortable.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I am so tired of eating average food that I might as well go back to H-Town where the food don't disappoint! This place is not a 4 it's a 3 unless  you  are drunk\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Entrees were ok, we got a muffelutta and a crawfish poboy. Both were what was expected for that type of entree selection. The oysters on the other hand came out dirty as if the shucker was careless while shucking. Lost of debris and shell shavings in the actual oyster.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Everything was mediocre.  Service was good but the waitress's shirt became progressively dirtier through the dinner until it was quite disgusting.  Better creole available. Conveyor the Sheraton and Marriott.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ok dinner...oysters had lots of broken shell in them and was disappointed. Average food and experience.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Was given the wrong to-go order. Unfortunately I did not realize until I got back to work...ughh.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We looked this restaurant up before coming on a vacation and looked good on the reviews and the menu,  we were disappointed, ordered a taste of New Orleans and was not impressed to say the least. We walked by other times after and noticed they are not very busy, so many other choices around, I should only given 2 stars for the lack of service.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We came here based off a recommendation from our hotel.  The food was fine but nothing impressive.  It was basic bar food.  The music was way too loud.  Impossible to have a conversation and we were there at 5:30 on a Saturday.  If you're in from out of town, try another place for dinner.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Hmmmmm it's decent. Not sure about the 'rave' reviews to be honest. The prices kind of turned me off. They have a brunch item of Kaya Toast which is to out it bluntly ridiculously overpriced. I can get a jar of Kaya from the Asian market for 1/10the price of the dish. Not impressed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Food was fantastic, service was so bad I wouldn't come back. They are severely understaffed, we finished eating 45 mins before we got the check. The hour and a half wait is completely unnecessary!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... 25$ for a shot of whiskey??? WTF??\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in tonight and decided to try the Hudson whiskey. I was left with a 25$ bill for it, and I couldn't believe my eyes. The scatterbrained waitress didn't even bother warning me about it before she left. The bottle costs only 60$, so I don't know how they can justify this cost.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Went for brunch. Drinks are two for one and food was very good, but wait time for a table was almost 2 hours. We were told that was normal for a weekend. If you are just in town visiting for a limited amount of time, it is not worth the wait.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Excellent food!! Terrible service!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tavern is only worth visiting if you're craving the food and go prepared for being all but forgotten about...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was average but the drinks were to die for! The bloody Mary's were definitely better than a normal Bloody Mary. They had a lot of pepper and were spicy. We had to wait a bit for a table but we sat at the bar while we waited so it went by quickly.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Was ok not child friendly food was ok nothing to write a book about. Waiter never came to check on us made a reservation with a high chair and got there and they said they dont have high chairs. Not sure why they say they did and was not good with a toddler\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... This is a small joint.  The cleanliness is terrible and parking is terrible.  Food over all is average.  Not out of this world.  Staff are friendly.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... My burger was boring and the help is not friendly. One employee did not seem to even understand English. It was a frustrating experience.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good food but apparently they refuse to answer the phone during dinner hours.  Tough to be able to phone in an order...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The burger are good but they get my order wrong 70% of the time. Is it so hard to read a ticket....make it accordingly ..and serve??? Very disappointing\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... They've raised their prices. Also, the salad I got to-go now comes in a smaller container. Sad.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food is tasty, I'll give them that. But when one buys a $9 cup of soup, to be you need to purchase a half baguette if you want a piece of bread with the soup because they are low on bread is absolutely ludicrous.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Quite disappointed.  Food was overall fine and I was able to eat it, but nothing special at all.   Latte was not good.  Got breakfast sandwich, salmon bagel, and biscuits. All were average at best.  Service was quite poor, told server that there were no clean utensils and he just blew past me.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I'm a big fan of pizza from a wood oven; however, the bottom of this pizza was very ashy and unfortunately that left a bad after taste. The pizza also was not that hot when I got it.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... One of those over rated brunch spot. Turkey sandwich was good, coffee was nice, but their chicken was dry and the disappointment builds up when you must wait for 45 minutes for your food (not including 45 minutes wait time.)\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Waited over an hour for a table for two on a Saturday morning. I understand that, being such a popular city for bachelorette trips. But there were plenty of open tables for long periods of time while waiting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. It was good...but not great. Did like the spicy honey on the table.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Not impressed. Wait time for two people over an hour. Menu is lacking. Too hipster of a joint. Food was not good and after a long wait it was very disappointing. Won't be returning. Don't waste your time.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... No lunch menu on Monday. Disappointing as I'm not a huge breakfast/brunch fan. Prosciutto Fig Jam \"toast\" not on toasted bread and with prosciutto, blue cheese and olives, way to salty. Need to skip one of those ingredients!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not that great. Went here for dinner with my husband recently. He had the duck, I had the grilled salmon. Both were sadly overcooked. The duck was tough and the salmon was so dry that the only way I could swallow it was with a gulp of water. I'm giving 3 stars because we had gone on a previous occasion and everything was good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We've gone twice and both times left disappointed. Service and food were just mediocre. The atmosphere is kind of gloomy, both times the restaurant has been mostly empty.  It feels like a place where there's a lot of turnaround and the servers are never fully trained. It's sad because we were fan of Splash!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not that good as I thought. Dessert is not delicate and crab leg taste not very fresh. Not many choice on food. And the line is so long that we spend more than 2 hours standing in line but not really worth it.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ate the Sunday Champagne brunch. Tiny glasses of champagne and compared to some other casino's the selection was limited. And there is NO CRAB on Sunday's. :(  The gelato station was out of order and I really wanted to try it. The staff was attentive though as a plus. Food was just so so.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Very meh. $30 something for dinner ($15 for children 4-10). You might as well go to In-N-Out and get exactly what you want. Sure there's variety and surely something for everyone, but really it's not that great. If you want to over pay to get stuffed on mediocre food, this is the place for you!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was decent and the drinks were fine. Nothing that really blew me away besides the mussels and I'm already a sucker for mussels in a white wine sauce.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... A lot of servers but not good service, everybody look upset and not happy. Makes you not happy too.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Went for the Gumbo and our waiter did not like that we only wanted gumbo and was rude and even had another waiter wait on us...guess next time we will go to Acme\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Disappointed in the Jazz. We were for brunch and the service was not as good as it could have been. They kept forgetting things. I would not go there again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Got lunch bloody marys on our french quarter bloody mary tour. These were good for $1.50. Otherwise unremarkable. Not worth a special trip\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The music is absolutely lovely, but don't get the old New Orleans fashioned.... it's worse than cough syrup and I got it without the simple syrup\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Gave this beignet proprietor another shot at its other location incredibly close and still wasn't impressed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Went for breakfast. The setting was cool with a live jazz band. Open seating and order your food from the counter. The waiter will bring it out to you. The food was not the best. I had the crawfish omelette and the eggs were not fluffy at all. The grits had no flavor. The beignets were dense and not fluffy. I had better.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Burger was awesome but the service was awful. Ordered duck fries which never came. Asked the waitress 3 times for them.  Didn't seem to care whether we got them or not. Overpriced as well. Overall I would rate as average\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was delicious.  Had cheeseburger wraps and stuff mushrooms.  Service was lacking.  Took a really long time and my order was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "They let me keep the wrong item and waived my iced tea.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Ordered from caviar tonight.  Packaging wasn't sealed properly and bag was saturated with sauce and broke and made a mess of my kitchen .. brown paper bag inside of plastic bag\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Went there for dinner. Menu looked interesting on paper, but, execution wasn't that great. Service was quick. They messed up two of the orders. My bison burger didn't taste like much. The pesto burger was great.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... The cheesesteaks and the wings are ok but the fries are horrible! Like really really bad! Some of my fries were so tough that I couldn't even chew them.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... The beef was not good there last night. We ordered the beef salad. The beef was very hard and when I are it without the other ingredients and dressing, it tasted horrible. It was either an old piece of beef or it was not stored properly. Disappointing.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Sadly ill be changing my review of this place to 2.5 stars....\n",
      "\n",
      "Crab cake sandwich people.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We went this place just because Mac (it's always sunny in Philadelphia) owns the place but it was a bad decision.\n",
      "Place was a bit airless, might because of the humidity, toilets were dirty and one of then was broken, bartender was careless and waitress was so nice.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Service not great and food feels very rushed. Overall just okay.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Decent food, bit over priced, marginal Bloody Mary's.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The to-go option is quick and you can sit on the adjacent picnic tables. The view is spectacular. May have ordered the wrong thing- lobster pasta. Seemed to be low quality lobster pieces in my dish. Clam chowder was better.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... local king crab for 18.95/lb is pretty tasty\n",
      "\n",
      "local crab $26 for 3lbs, got 3 half parts of crabs, 1 part was bad  :(\n",

      "\n",
      "lobster bisque was not good, too tomato-y\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We normally love the clam chowder here, but today it was flavorless and disappointing.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I had really high expectation for this place but it was just kinda Meh.. The boil crab was not fresh even tho we paid $35 for it. altho the pasta and soup was tasty. but the crab just ruined my mood to enjoy anything else. Maybe it was a bad catch and I just got unlucky?\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It was a little disappointing.\n",
      "Good view but Bad service.The food was okay.\n",
      "I won't highly recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Just was not feeling the food here, drinks were good. Food wasn't awful, but not great either.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Honestly, didn't live up to the hype. Food was definitely good but was not BBQ that blew me out of the water. And the corn bread was SOO DRY. Disappointing. Hoping it was just a bad night but seeing as I was visiting Nashville for the first time, I probably won't be going back when I visit again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Meh, they run out of their famous brisket frequently and don't serve BBQ ribs until dinner time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the pulled pork, which they are 'known for' according to the cashier, was mediocre \n",
      "\n",
      "Disappointing for a southern bbq joint\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... IT IS SO DAMN HOT HERE. their fried pickles are the best in town, i absolutely love them. however, when i went in today it was hot as hell. no AC at all. people were fanning themselves and the workers were visibly uncomfortable and sweating. it's hotter inside than outside and that's saying something for nashville in July.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Often out of food\n",
      "I'm not sure how a bbq place rotinely runs out of food, but this place often does. No brisket, no turkey, no okra......no this, no that.  When they do have food, it's the best bbq in town. Just be prepared not to find some food\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I only had a cannoli. It was good but not great. I agree with another reviewer who said that it would be better dipped in chocolate. The chocolate chips just don't come through enough, and the shell seemed overcooked.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was delicious but, we had a problem 2x with the delivery service & have not been back. Hopefully they get it figured out eventually.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I went here for lunch and had the goi cuon cold rolls and Banh mi with a Vietnamese coffee.  I have had better Vietnamese Banh mi and Goi Cuon, but I've also had worse. Food arrived quickly. Seating filled during the lunch hour.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was not anything outstanding. Actually I didn't really like it for the price. Then customers were being sat around the edge of the restaurant. Our waiter was not around much, so the service experience was lame\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Location was good, right on the square. Judging from the crowds, I expected greatness. My expectations were not met. The goat cheese crepes were awesome, as was the Puppyfish, but the seafood au gratin just serviceable. Bread- meh.  Dessert was weak. Maybe I'm just tired of eating.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... food was great but service is very bad. our server never asked how our food was or if we need anything else. the server for drinks is so slow. my bf's mother waited for her wine for almost 20 minutes.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We went for lunch on the recommendation of two different people.  The place itself is gorgeous but the service we had was terrible.  Staff seemed bored and were not friendly. The pork chop with red beans and rice was really salty.  Probably our least favorite meal of our four days in NOLA\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was good. Nothing to rave about, but I have no complaints about it. The host was not very welcoming and the service was impersonal. It made the dining experience a bit uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't go back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Delicious milk punch.  Bad wine.  Bad sazerac.  Good service.  Freezing inside. Really lumpy mashed Potatoes.  Overall, not the best experience.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Not pet friendly!\n",
      "You can bring your dog and sit out in the parking lot but then no one to serve you. Makes no sense!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I made a to-go order and received a burnt black bean burger. Figured while eating it for lunch, tasted bitter. Dissapointed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Was in the area but was not being too adventurous so I went here. I ordered the Ranch Chicken sandwich combo. The chicken was fried with ranch dressing, lettuce, cheese, and tomato all inside the bun. All in all, it was okay. My only complaint was the fries were cold.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Too early to tell with this place as of yet. Time will tell. They need to rotate beef stock more ...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... If your looking for sushi on the cheap.. They do ok here. Can't beat it for the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Came here because we had a 10% off coupon. Arrived to find the place practically empty.  Ordered off the lunch menu.  Got the steak and shrimp along with some sushi.  I won't say it was bad, but I've had a lot better. I would look for another establishment unless this was the only choice.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The sushi wasn't great, just OK. The half-price deal they have for sushi made it definitely worth it though. I'll be back for sure.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Sushi and service are good.  They put all of the sushi from each sheet on same platter, so you have to only order several rolls per sheet.  Kinda dumb why they wouldn't think of that already.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... enjoyed the atmosphere.  the cannabis infused drink was a bit toooooo strong.  Other than that, it was a great visit but not a place I would go monthly.  A bit overpriced and over hyped.  They didnt even have any desserts we wanted to try.  That was very disappointing.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... They have good coffee at Milktooth but the menu is a bit overpriced and the food is not worth the prices. It's a hipster brunch place that in my opinion is kinda overrated.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Overhyped. We were told it would be a 45 min wait and ended up waiting 1.5 hours. Wait time aside the food was average. Water was served warm. Food was brought out at different times for everyone at the table.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... This place is a bit over-rated. The food is good but over priced and the refusal of modifications is pretentious given it's a diner. The drinks were TERRIBLE. Way too sweet and not at all complex.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food is good I've been here several times. The service is really spotty. They don't make any changes to the menu. Weird vibe.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... This was a distinctively underwhelming experience. While it is a very hip space, the disinterested service and bland food left me wanting more.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I really didn't get the hype. I could tell the food was really high quality, but I had a lamb burger type of thing and I just wasn't that into it. I'll have to try again!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I have mix feelings about this place, I had a baby pancake, they served with caramel popcorn, I almost broke my tooth because there were some un-popped popcorn. For the prices I think Chefs could be more careful.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Amazing eclectic food and staff that you won't find anywhere else, but rude service. Get ready to stand directly up against the wall and be asked to move closer a thousand times by the staff.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food is good I've been here several times. The service is really spotty. They don't make any changes to the menu. Weird vibe.   \n",
      "\n",
      "They open at 7 am, but don't Serve full menu until 9 am.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I felt like I was in a Portlandia episode.  \n",
      "$12 for 1 waffle.  Pffffft! The Bloody Mary was undrinkable -way too spicy. Overpriced IMO.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I used to love Milktooth for brunch but the last two times I went the food was too salty and my server was not nice at all!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Eh, the food was okay but nothing to write home about. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood or maybe I had hyped the restaurant up so much before going but it wasn't that mind blowing\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ordered crab cakes. They came with vegetables: carrots, zucchini, potatoes, red peppers. Nothing was hot. Very lukewarm. Enjoyed sitting outside, however, the chairs are not the most comfortable chairs I have ever sat in.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... the pre-made pizzas never look quite appetizing enough to try. \n",
      "a made-to-order calzone took forEVER and was not cheap, but it was indeed tasty.  \n",
      "service is gruff, but i don't really care so long as my calzone is good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We went there 8/19/19.  The service was good, but the food was bland.  They offered to make something else or give us some seasonings, we chose to add some seasonings.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food at BK is good, but nothing special. The spot is good if you want a quick Mexican meal at a reasonable price. The serving size is rather small in my opinion (i.e. 3 tacos) so order appropriately. I'd come back but I'm in no rush.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It is good but also the most over rated mexican restaurant in town. Sometimes it is sublime but the quality is unpredictable and the sonoran dogs are always served cold. (And not just cold from the toppings, literally 80 degrees. I checked.)\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I was so eager to try this place. I ordered the cube steak and green beans and mashed potatoes. Everything was good except for the mashed potatoes. Very disappointed. Thought they would be home made but they are instant mash. Thumbs down for that.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The Prime Rib always had such a good name. I have been there once and I just wasn't that impressed. Maybe next time.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Usually we are very pleased. Today we were disappointed, the prime rib was far from tender.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It's in an old gas station. Since I am doing a take out, not sure how good is the food yet \n",
      "Rating a 3 star since I haven't eaten the food yet! Hoping the rating fits.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Upland nachos are very good and plenty for everyone. Ordered pork and chicken. Just the right temperature. $2 pints on Sunday!\n",
      "Would be a great bar to watch a sporting event but the TV's are so small it is difficult to see a game\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Great beer. Weak food, I thought. Wasn't bad, just well overpriced and nothing special. Will definitely be back for more beer and am going to try out more items on the menu before updating the review/rating accordingly.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Behind the bar had some odd experiences with bartenders telling people to \"keep it down, it's a family place!\"  Beer is good, food is good.  The limits on high abv beer, weak.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Mediocre service and food. Nothing special but it hits the spot when you're craving Japanese and don't have time to drive elsewhere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We enjoy Sushi Teri while camping in Carp. Its a go to stop for us. Food is always fresh and we like that they dont over use rice on the rolls. Have tried many items on the menu with no complaints.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good tasting food and value. Having been spoiled by Jasmine in West Chester, the lack of ambience and rather typical menu disappointed a bit. But it was quick and reasonable and quite busy.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... They go cheap on ingredients.  Papaya salad has no dry shrimp.  Pad Thai don't have those minced pickled veggie.  Spring roll was like mall food.  Not a fan.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... After being here a few times I had to change my review. There are so many Thai places that combined with the varying quality of this place, we ended up moving on.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Longtime fan both dine-in and take-out, but the food and service aren't close to what they were.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Came for brunch. I ordered the gulf coast omelette, which is ok. Country potatoes were below average. I'll return to check the lunch menu next time.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The service is good.  My jambalaya was cold, salty, and disappointing.  It was the least impressive meal I had considered it was somewhat pricey.  There are way better dining experience elsewhere all over town.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I'm only them giving them 3 stars because their ribeye was very very good. I got the jambalaya pasta and it was horrible. Frozen shrimp, hard stale sausage and the sauce tasted like left over sloppy joe sauce mixed with spaghetti. The bathroom was disgusting!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Service was friendly, and gets an additional star, but the place is a tourist trap. Cajun jambalaya pasta had no bite; I might as well have gone to a Cheesecake Factory in Nebraska.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Red beans were ok. Nothing special. The blacked red fish is really good though. Not large portions but decent. Lots of other places to check out before ever coming back\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Takes way too long and wasn't that great. Lots of staff but they dont give much attention. Portions were large but not worth it. The only thing I like was the charbroiled bacon oysters.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The servers were really nice.\n",
      "The bread on my po boy was really tough, I ended up just eating the shrimp.\n",
      "The fries were fried in grease that was too hot because the inside of the potato was still hard.\n",
      "The fried alligator was good, it was my first time trying alligator.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was good but the hostess was crazy rude .  Once we got past her the experience was much better and worth the wait.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... No fue lo que esperaba en cuanto a calidad precio. El lugar es lindo , el servicio bueno y la comida normal.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We had the gumbo and shrimp po-boy. The gumbo was good the po-boy portion was disappointing and overpriced.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was good. I think i must have picked the wrong night to go or maybe it was just to late. Will give them another try next time im in town.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Decent beer selection. The raw oysters were quite good. The crawfish cakes were a disappointment over all. The sauce was good, but I was missing the crawfish in the cakes. Service for our party (at the bar) was hit and miss.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The host and servers were great! Nice and polite. But the food was salty. I order pasta with a crab cake & shrimp Alfredo. The shrimp was salty. This was my 1st stop when coming to NOLA. I was not a fan.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Front of the house has no idea what they are doing. Half the tables are open while a long wait list stands outside.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was sub par. Definitely a white-washed (taste wise) version of creole food. The sever was great, but the food was bland. Would NOT recommend.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Decent food. Nothing special & nothing bad. Horrid service.\n",
      "I'm sure they need to turn the tables quickly, but I wasn't spending McDonald's money & a 40 minute rush  out ( dessert included) is unacceptable. \n",
      "Maybe they are better at breakfast service.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Average, food wasn't seasoned as well as expected.   Had shrimp poor boy and stuffed fish. Also had alligator bites and crab cakes. Nothing exceptional. Bread pudding was good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ok nothing special , was hoping to get more meat in my gumbo but basically got a bowl of rice  with broth.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Server was very nice. Food was served promptly. A little high priced for what we got but it was 2 weeks after Ida. A lot of of items on menu weren't available fresh.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Don't order the fish tacos- they were very disappointing. I didn't even want to eat them. Order the burger. It was very good. Restaurant is a little overpriced for what it is.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Went here on a Friday for a late lunch / early dinner. Was ok - food was fine, not amazing but ok. Waitress brought us the bill immediately after clearing our plates which was strange considering it wasn't busy, so shouldn't have been necessary to push us through? But hey ho.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was good but not worth an hour wait time to be seat plus an additional hour after we placed our order.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Cool atmosphere. I've only been for brunch though. And was a little disappointed considering the price. It didn't live up to the expectations set prior to going.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I really want to like Tavern, but I've given it three chances and still think it's overpriced and not all that good. It gets three stars because of its location and the BOGO drink tokens, but the food ranges from reasonably tasty to utterly tasteless depending on the day.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Came here on a Monday evening with a party of 7. Waitress was nice and polite. I'm not sure if it was too busy for the chef or what, but we waited forever for the food and when it showed up some of it was soggy and cold. This was disappointing. Might be worth another try on a different night but we left feeling a bit let down.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was mediocre at best. Tables were on top of one another. And it was so loud that you could not hear yourself think. Staff was friendly but distracted and the decor was early I don't know what.  They want to turn the tables and we felt pressured to  leave. Definitely not a relaxed dining experience\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The SB farmers market bowl tasted pretty bad. It was literally a bowl of raw spinach two eggs and majority mushrooms. I am very disappointed to say the least. However, the crispy potatoes and the coffee may be a redeeming factor in my decision to return. Nice staff too.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Service was good given the fact that it was SEC weekend. We waited about an hour to get seated! The food was alright but nothing too special.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Trendy place but seemed slightly over priced for the actual flavor and quality of food. I got a salad and a pastry. Overall, just decent.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I can see why people like this place. However, I am not a fan. Wish that there was more menu choices, I feel like there wasn't much that appealed to me.  And I'm not picky by any means\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Most average breakfast food. Why would I want to wait 45 minutes for tiny portions of standard food? Many better options in the Gulch. \n",
      "\n",
      "My coffee was no better than gas station coffee, and they did not offer free refills.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Had the Hot Mess which was neither not nor messy. Tiny portions of ingredients on a large biscuit was marginal at best. A bit disappointing after a long wait. Wouldn't go back. Staff was however attentive and very polite.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Decent food! Service was not great our waitress hardly checked in on us and it took forever to order. Food could be improved\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Another trendy Gulch zone restaurant where people enjoy waiting in line. Not sure why. Food was average to just above average and the service passable. I'm not motivated to return.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Wait was out of control! 2 hours just to sit down. I'm not sure if it's like this every day but it was the Saturday we went. I would skip and go to another restaurant.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Sadly disappointed by everything. Cocktails, were just doing too much. Too many flavors and twists. Food was nothing to write home about. We tried 3 dishes. It wasn't bad, but nothing that would make me want to come back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... like the idea of everything from scratch, but could be better...I think it is just too big and busy to keep up with the quality...food did not come out all at once, so our party was eating at different times...best part was the bloody mary, which i found out the mix is the only thing they do not make in house...go figure...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Salads are really good.  Other menu items have been inconsistent for quality and pricing.  How can the same menu items cost nearly twice as much if you pick them up from grab and go versus calling in an order?  Most bakery items have been a consistent disappointment.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They are new and making adjustments but it is taking awhile.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nothing phenomenal. Was \"trendy\" and not worth the hour wait. Bloody Mary was good but food was only okay and didn't have a huge menu.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Gone down the drain since Chip and Tom are no longer there.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... My mom and I went here for brunch last weekend. Just skip the food and go straight to the dessert. The cheesecake is HEAVEN and the macaroons are to die for.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Came for Brunch after volunteering at the Susan G Komen race. Food was good But service was major lacking on refills. Waitress walking by and even when ask for refill still not get until you ask the gentleman clearing tables.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The Food is not the same The Omelette was good, the porkchop was good but the croissant was very hard and cold I think they should work on that a little bit more I don't think I'll be coming back no time soon\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We went to Eldorado, not knowing it was closed for remodeling. As far as I know, the name will be changed and thus the signs directing people there.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Decided on the 6-course vegetarian route. The food and presentation were both good but failed to impress. Although it is a 6-course meal, I felt wanting more. In other words, I was not satisfied... portion-wise.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Went for lunch. Had a burger, it was tasty and cooked well. Our server, Katelynd, should probably find a job outside the realm of hospitality, though.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Had dinner at this restaurant several weeks ago and was excited to try it, but unfortunately the food was just OK. Portions were somewhat small, menu did not excite, and we all felt a bit let down by the food. Perhaps this place is better for brunch - sadly, not on my list of dinner spots to return to.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It's ok. They got our order wrong (it was only 2\n",
      "Drinks) and seemed annoyed to remake. Atmosphere is cool. I'll try it again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Saturday night at 9pm and the staff is overwhelmed and the food is average.  For the price it was not a value.  Try someplace else\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ok spot, just ok. Not impressed. Not worth the price, least favorite. Opened on Sunday when other places are closed. Sunday is family day. Good for appetizers and maybe a drink, but should have stopped there\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... We decided to stop in and check out the BBQ shrimp that everyone was raving about. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered an appetizer to share and it was not our cup of tea.  In all of the places that I have been I have never been served shrimp with the heads on. \n",
      "\n",
      "Turned us off.  Check please. Maybe for some people but not us.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Stop with the nonsense. This place is mediocre at best. The BBQ shrimp are ok. Overcooked a little mushy. Way over priced for the quality. Sat at the bar. Bartender is ok not great.  Menu is boring.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ate there this weekend, supper busy. Food was not up to their usual quality. Steak overdone and the Gumbo was average at best. I expect much more from a Brennan Rest. Disappointed   with the service and the food. Will probably go to Commander's Palace next time instead.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Complete tourist turnover place. The roux was nearly burned for the gumbo ya ya. The shrimp were slightly over cooked  and hard to peel and service was on the slow side. Thanks to Terrence I'm not sure we would have been served otherwise.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... So if you only get the bbq shrimp and grits- then this would be 5 stars\n",
      "unfortunately- the rest of the menu doesn't keep up.\n",
      "service was pretty mediocre and rinks were \"ehh'\n",
      "\n",
      "so come here for the shrimp and grits!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Service is ok. Takes forever to get anyone's attention and even long to get the food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not impressed. Had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation on a Sunday night. Wait staff not attentive. Food was just ok in my opinion. The highlight was dessert, chocolate lava cupcake. Too loud to carry on a conversation.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The price of my beloved BBQ shrimp when up $10 since last year for the same portions. I understand covid times, but $31 is way too steep.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Bloody Mary is too small, fried oysters were delicious & the Jambalaya pasta was lukewarm...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Long line to order and wait again, but it was much quicker then other places, and they bring the food to you. Only ordered the beignets,  can't imagine trying to eat an actual breakfast or lunch there with allllllll those people watching you.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Definitely come here for the outdoorsy seatings and live jazz/rhythm and blues. I ordered beignets and Cafe Au Lait. Both were mediocre.  The beignets were too doughy.  I didn't like it much.  Go to Cafe Du Monde for the good stuffs. But stop by here for the music and ambiance.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good beignets made fresh just didn't like the seating all outside. The tables were very dirty didn't want to touch them but the birds had a field day eating off them\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Love the atmosphere. Hated my first poboy sandwich. So plain and barely any fish in it. And no sauce.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I do not see that much of a difference with cafe du monde's beignet. If anything i'd rather come here any time and avoid the lines and the hassle.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Jazz in the courtyard all day! 3stars for the beignets (s/b light & fluffy, lightly dusted w powdered sugar, hollow inside), not flat, dense & solidly covered w sugar. 4stars for the live jazz at 10am!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... L'endroit est très sympa en terrasse avec des musiciens mais pour les plats c'est moyen\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Beignets are good but nothing to bring me back. You will probably go here as a tourist being that you are trying to navigate your way through this street/area.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The beignets are ok-- crispy, square and sort of flat. The flavor is ok and they came out piping hot.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Went there with my friend and it was a mess.The restaurant is very understaffed. The workers looked stressed out and they didn't have enough time or people to even wipe off the tables. The ones that were open looked pretty disgusting.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Our first beignets in New Orleans.  Order and pay at the counter.  They were not sweet enough and on the chewy side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tables to sit down and they didn't really clear or clean them.  We had to grab some napkins to clean out table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They offer limited champagne and wine.  Other baked goods and coffee.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Iced cafe au lait was delicious. The beignets were large but nothing special.  I'd go back for the coffee and live jazz bands but that's about it.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Don't bring a group larger then 4 as there is no room. Went to try it and could not get in for over an hour at 330 in the afternoon. Looked like a cool place but could not experience it\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Crowded and we believe we got the wrong cocktail. We got the pigs in a blanket and those were good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Ribs were good, but then again I would have eaten a dead horse.  Need to try again down the road.  The service was very friendly.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Unless you're in it for the convenience of location, it's not very good. There are better food options downtown.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We were looking for a late night place to eat downtown, and I was shocked to see so many people there.  The place serves its purpose - good for a beer and bar food.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you go you really have no choice but to get the award-winning Caleco's buffalo wings (by the way, it's pronounced kuh-LAY-koes).\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Extensive menu so do ask your wait staff for recommendations. We had the nacho appetizers which were solid expected fare. I had the club and the honey had the philly roast beef sandwich. Both were tasty. Although it's was nothing spectacular, I was thankful it was a short walk from the hotel and a friendly atmosphere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Interesting food here. Nachos are like none I've ever seen, and not all that great. The root beer float was good, but c'mon how hard is that to get right? TVs were so loud we couldn't even talk to each other.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food is hot, but very bland. Also didn't come with any chopsticks, plasticware or napkins...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I've had better. For the prices, the portions don't add up. Love that it's BYOB, but you can find a BYOB Thai restaurant with more menu options and bigger portions. I'll pass on this place in the future.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Underwhelming experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "True - this place is in a prime location, has the allure of a BYOB, and looks \"fancy\" but I felt tricked. Detach the food from the setting and it'd be mediocre. Portions were also tiny for the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Would only suggest coming here for a beer or when it's slower. Good beer, but really slow service and just average food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... First visit, trying to learn the menu.  Will try it again, liked the menu options but the beer wasn't that memorable and it appeared to be understaffed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Just had delivery, took 30 min, had duck fresh rolls and Pad Thai, a bit expensive but tasty for delivery. Tons of food enough for 2-3 people.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... this place has closed. the window says they have moved to macdade blvd in folsom, pa.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Cozy place. Surprised after 5 rounds there was no buy back. Was quiet on Black Friday but picked up later in the night\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Stopped in here lastnight because we heard good things.  Wont go back.  Very unfriendly unwelcoming place.  Bartender very uninterested in anything but his phone.  Saw some food come out and thought it looked good.  Unfortunately this place is off my list.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food is average. The beer selection is decent and the prices are on par w other similar places in the area. More of a touristy place than anything else.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not terribly friendly bartenders (the two men, anyway). Very much a small divey bar which is ok but don't expect any frills. A few tvs let us watch the NBA finals, no wifi, basic pub food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We stopped into Mac's after having cheesesteaks next door. The bartender was friendly. Our friend ordered calamari but the batter was very soft & it was mostly fried peppers instead of calamari so that was disappointing. Coming here for drinks is fine but I don't think I'd ever order food here.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We ordered take out and ate by the ocean on the pier! Food was kind of pricey and not enough for the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Tasty food. Slightly marked up with prices but that's to be expected since it is on Stearn's Wharf. LONG WAIT!!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... More of a tourist site than a place to go for value and good food.  Don't get me wrong as the shell fish is good and fresh but very expensive and terrible atmosphere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The crab is ok. The location is very nice. The lobster bisque was disappointing.. no lobster! :(\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was ok but not spectacular. The seating was remarkably uncomfortable, and the noise level was very high.  It definitely was not worth the wait.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Just know you're going for the people that work there and that quaint ocean pier ambiance.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I had high expectations for freshness and flavor finally having Santa Barbara sea urchin in Santa Barbara. The disappointment of the uni and scallop over lime was only eased by the tasty abalone over tomato basil rice. The rock crab gets a thumbs up.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was okay. I was disappointed, I thought it would a lot more flavorful. I use love the clam chowder here but as of recently it lacks flavor.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It took forever for us to get our food. Then my high priced Lobster was over cooked and had no flavor. They also need to consider adding more stalls to there restrooms. There was a huge line.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I forgot we also got an oyster shotter $2.50, I was ok for the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Spectacular vIew from the wharf. Food came out cold, otherwise I would  rate it higher. Wait staff did not stop by to see how everything was.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Fast service but food wasn't what I expected coconut shrimp, no flavor. The pasta wasn't that good but the calamari was pretty well made.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I thought it was alright. Food was alright and the service was alright I wouldn't want to go again. Price was kinda pricey for what we ate. And overall the place was not that good just alright. And good enough to visit once but wouldn't go again...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Tasty seafood but real pricey. Depending on how long you have to wait not worth it in my opinion. Lobster roll, clam chowder and fried shrimp for $50. If you're out in the area go ahead and try but I wouldn't come back\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Really long wait...The restaurant needs pagers or some kind of system to allow guests to wander around while they wait over an hour.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Pro-Tip: this is definitely a tourist trap.  Expect 40min-1hr lines for nothing-special steamed seafood fare with a premium price tag served on soggy paper plates.  Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad... but not THAT good to justify the lines, price, presentation, and what you get.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Ordered 2 of the lobster burritos. Disappointed as there was very little lobster. Staff was very friendly but to-go orders at side window were mixed up.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It was good but expect a long wait. Got the shrimp ceviche and a dungeons crab. Must be California prices the crab was almost $100 for a 2.5 pound crab. For four of us it was $200.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The shrimp tacos were delicious. The lobster pasta was not good at all, lobster was super dry and the seasoning was way off it was all around bad. Clam chowder was very good. I recommend you try this place but stay away from the lobster pasta.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We were visiting Nashville for business and everyone raved about this place so we had to try it. This is an average BBQ joint. The service and food were good but nothing like the hype.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I really wish they wouldn't put BBQ in their name. I hail from Memphis, so I am a bbq snob. This is NOT bbq! I like their brisket, cornbread, and Mac and cheese, but if you want real BBQ, go somewhere else.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Brunch is my jam here but even if it's not busy be prepared to wait about 40 minutes for your food. Makes no sense at all... Ate here with a friend and their food came out about 10 mins before mine.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... They ran out of the brisket before 1pm and honestly not sure what else I could order since we came here for the bbq.   They do serve cat fish and chicken.   It's good but not impressive.  The side dishes are very average\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It was good. I was expecting my ribs to fall off the bones but overall, I'd give it another try since I hear so much about this place and will maybe request a more tender order.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good, not great. I reada review that this is one of Nashvilles top 10 \"must tries\". Cute place, not expensive, GREAT fried pickles, decent BBQ.,\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Bummer-got a pound of bbq to go and found out that its not sent w/ any sauce. Just assumed it would come w/bbq sauce. Live and learn I guess.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The pizza was acceptable, but not great. It was delivered on time and hot.  The menu on here is not accurate, as they do not offer feta cheese or artichoke hearts.  They don't mess around with the cheese though... very cheesy.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Wish I could give it more stars, pastries are great but service was very rude. The girl at the counter had a huge attitude problem- this was on a Tuesday evening right before close. Management should have a discussion with employees on common courtesy and customer service.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We visited Termini Bros as we toured Reading Market. The cannoli we ordered was very good. The pig ear pastry was bland, dry and hard to chew. A lot of other baked goods to choose from at Termini Bros. We would order the cannoli again but not the pig ear pastry.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Was in NOLA for a conference and one of our group made plans to have dinner with a colleague. She chose this spot. Food was ok, but the service was very rushed at the end.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Very inefficient. Girls at front counter more interested in talking to each other rather than seething people. Empty tables.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good was good but poor service.  Didn't get my drink till well after meal and I had to remind them.  Meal took forever.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... This place was OK nothing to really write home to mom about kind of like a cafeteria,food was average weight staff was very friendly quick to seat us no real complaints but nothing to cheer about either\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Portions are small for the prices. Food is just okay. Ordered hash brown and instead received their potatoes. Instead of taking my whole plate back our server brought out hash browns when we were finished.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Great food, great service. Must order the goat cheese and crawfish crepes - original recipe that is applicable for today's palate. The bouillabaisse was bland and a bit on the oily side so stay away. Bread pudding is decent but not the best as they proclaim.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... TOURIST TRAP!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "average food. average service. above average prices. food takes too long. save your time and money\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Drinks are killer.  They make a great old fashioned.  Shrimp and grits is the go to entree.  Don't bother with the duck hash. After the second plate (first one was cold) I still struggled to find the duck amongst the potatoes.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... With drinks brunch was 80 bucks- that felt steep and I wasn't \"in love\" with the food. It was an average southern meal... Shrimp, eggs benny, hash, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the money, I'd encourage you to keep looking.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Crawfish and goat cheese crepes!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I gave it 3 stars just for the food being so expensive and not so good.  As for the Beer it was great and we walked out with two 6 packs. I would just go for the beer not the food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Menu has very limited options for food options. The turkey sandwich was very very dry.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Place for latest night eats around and drive through is a must. New menu items and some veggie options etc. forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so I was very bummed when I noticed far too late!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Average sushi in our opinion.  If I was in the mood for sushi and close by I'd probably hit it up again, but wouldn't go out of my way.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Average pizza. Nice garden salad. Was ok but wouldn't do it again. Nothing special. Crust ok but not thin like advertised.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It's fast food pizza.  Comparable to Rusty's or Giovanni's, but a far cry from Nutbelly.  If you're from Chicago or NY you should stay home and make your own.  If you're out having beers and need some melty cheese on dough this might just hit the spot.  If you like TV, dine in.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I got the cobb salad here. It was average, nothing special. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend got the tiramisu ice cream, it was delicious!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd come in for the ice cream but not for the regular food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Casual BYO.\n",
      "Portabella sandwich was pretty delicious. Fries are not the best here. Pretty standard salad.\n",
      "Omelettes are good, but nothing special.\n",
      "Friendly service, but a bit of a wait on food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... came here for a corporate dinner, great view and impeccable service, however, the food is mediocre. I had the filet mignon, nothing special. come here to hangout for the view and get a drink, but not for the food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I have only been here for cocktails so can't comment on the food. The space is beautiful and offers a stunning view of the city's skyline. Cocktails are well-crafted and delicious but pricey. This is the type of high-end lounge that takes itself a little too seriously. Hence the kind of place I tend to avoid.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Gorgeous view but the food wasn't great. I don't mind spending loads of money on food that is worth it. But here you just pay for the view.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Enjoyed the view. Food and service at the table was good but trying to get a drink at the almost empty bar was a struggle!  Bartender looked right through us.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The bill isn't worth the view...proteins were good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were also worried we wouldn't get seated though we made reservations.  One of our guests showed up the previous week with reservations and they were unable to seat them.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Average. No idea why more than 3 stars. Food? Meh. Service? Good. Decor? Hotel garbage.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Ordinary food, eggplant was so covered in sauce that had practically no crawfuah or crabmeat. Salads we ordered as entrees were enormous but plain lettuce.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Hum...\n",
      "\n",
      "So the waitress was new and couldn't recommend anything.   She didn't know what ahi tuna was either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food for me was good. I had some type of stuffed peppers with shrimp and crab.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... The wait was long, they ran out of silverware and glassware. The food took an hour to come out and the seafood basket tasted all the same. We will give it another try but will try a dish that's not fried.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Ever since they expanded the service has gone down. Took over 30 min to get a shrimp poboy.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Oyster po boy was cold,had to ask for manager...need more servers..ate there other times was good\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Recommended seafood restaurant but we weren't throughly impressed although we didn't have time to try the complete menu, the oysters were okay but we're on our way to Bobby Hebert's Cajun Cannon.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not bad but definitely over rated. Sangria tasted like cream soda and wasn't too impressed with our pizza either. Was really expecting more.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I signed up for yelp just to write how \"eh\" this place is. I have no idea who they paid off to get all those glowing reviews in the newspaper. The food was eh, the service was eh, my pizza was eh, my drinks were good but overpriced so therefore eh. It looks nice in there but nothing special - just eh.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food is overpriced.you get a small portion for what your actually paying for i had the fusilli al pesto pasta with shrimp which i paid 20 dollars for and i only got 4 shrimps.. i wont be returning back to this place anytime soon..... but the waitress was awesome..\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We went there on a crowded Sunday night.  It was a whirlwind of employees moving throughout the restaurant which was a little unnerving.  Though for $30 for two people to eat dinner and decent food, it was fine.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Last I ate there 2 days ago the asparagus / mushroom w/ Salmon wasn't v good . Service is excellent BUT the salmon wasn't v fresh and little asparagus and mushrooms.. adequate but that's it\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Great music and awesome place but the wait staff wasn't very good.  They need to be more attentive to their clients.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Stopped by to have a beer, a snack, listen to some music and watch the Masters.  Ordered the nachos which were ok, not great. But the rest of my requirements were met.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Went for lunch for a buffet.  No chutney, no curry dishes.  Super expensive for a lunch buffet. The server wouldn't acknowledge us when we said thank you.  Some food  was spicy without being noted or warned.  Not impressed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The curries are good, but they aren't at all spicy. I'll ask for 10/10 Indian hot, and they usually give me what other places would consider the mildest. If you're looking for heat, go elsewhere, but if not, give it a try.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... terrific front desk staff, clean rooms, terribly slow and unfriendly bar/waitress service in lobby.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Nice hotel but not real fond of waiting 2 hours past check in time just to check in.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... My wife and I went back yet again on a Sunday afternoon. We had the same server as before, and essentially the same experience; this time I had a decent steak melt sandwich and my wife had a decent sirloin steak with broccoli and a salad. One thing about chains, they're nothing if not consistent.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It's a great place to eat. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because our waitress was drunk (admited it) and she forgot about our food. Very unprofessional.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food is usually OK\n",
      "Service is usually good\n",
      "I didn't like the prickly pear margarita, too sweet.\n",
      "But I did like the patron margarita\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not sure why it's so popular.. the happy hour is not bad but all the female servers there were just so unpleasant..... went in for ramen another time and there were barely broth in the bowl and the ramen is def not worth the price... won't recommend going..\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Three stars, because the food was not that good, I went there because it was mention on a food magazine. Just average, but the service is really below average. Despite the fact that is a REALLY small place.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The ramen noodle was cooked right.\n",
      "The broth is way too salty. \n",
      "Another \"Asian-fusion\" restaurant to trick you westerners into thinking you are cool you had authentic ramen. \n",
      "So if you are familiar with real Japanese ramen, you might be disappointed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... broth taste strange...... and they put kimchi in ramen which makes the taste really weird\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Tasty and cute decor inside, but lack of vegetarian options makes it unlikely that I will return. I've been to other ramen/noodle places with amazing vegetarian and vegan options! Unfortunate that cheu doesn't accommodate much.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Overrated.  My broth was lukewarm, it wasn't spicy, and the flavors were weak.  It's OK - not worth waiting an hr for.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... overpriced for the portion of food they give. needed more flavor. was ok, but not worth coming back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... If you're looking for karaoke, this is your place. Otherwise expect average Chinese food and bubble tea. They even brought out an entirely wrong dish and had a random Asian TV channel playing for everyone although just music would have been nice. Probably won't visit again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Out of lager and serving Jagerschnitzel that was way too salty and covered in salad dressing. This is German food? Nein Danke. Portions are appropriate for a German stomach.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... 和大多是的这边的饭店一样的好吃的程度，就这样，不高 不底！总体印象就是地面不干净，粘脚，也不平整，腥味大，整体的清洁度不是很满意！但是服务小哥还不错！和大多是的这边的饭店一样的好吃的程度，就这样，不高 不底！总体印象就是地面不干净，粘脚，也不平整，腥味大，整体的清洁度不是很满意！但是服务小哥还不错！\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet, I'd go there again only because they are open late and we came from the airport.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was OK but very bad experience (the waitress dropped the source on me and my food). They did apologize but did nothing about my food. I tried to be nice though coz something like that happens. However, even I said nothing, what they responded was disappointing. Won't come back:-(\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not too good, not too bad. Service was slow but food was okay. Probably not worth the money though\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Had dinner here on my trip to NOLA. Food was tasty just a tad on the salty side for my taste.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... overpriced.  Had the swordfish and it was dry, possibly over cooked.  It was also about 6 ounces.  $28 for a 6 oz swordfish that wasn't very good.  Disappointing.  Overall it's a nice restaurant but it is overrated.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Went there for Sunday brunch and was disappointed with food, menu and ambience. Oysters were good though. Will not return\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Had the gumbo; pretty average. Seafood in it was soggy and sort of mealy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Small but decent bar.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The experience overall was very disappointing. I ordered the entouffee and the dish was very salty and could not finish even half of it. The oysters were fresh and large in size. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was unsatisfactory. The restaurant was not busy but we were seated near the door next to a really loud table.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was ok but not the same for service, it took forever for me to be seated despite the fact that there were several empty tables available.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... While the food was ok, I am not accustomed to begging for a coffee refill. I do not like being treated as if I am invisible.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food...excellent.  Service, extremely subpar for such a highly-rated establishment.  Service in need of repair.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We had the lamb dish and the shrimp and grits which were both served piping hot. Our server was pleasnt but very busy!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nothing special , average classic American concept food . It is not a restaurant gives you good after delish memorable   taste . You can experience this restaurant for one time and nothing special about it\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food was good but the waitress never followed up and I got sprayed with the disinfectant for the table next to me.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Probably my least favorite meal in Née Orleans. My mussels were overcooked, bland and fishy. Tried a couple other dishes at the table, the crawfish étouffée was delicious but everything else was middle of the road. Not particularly good or bad, just middle of the road at best.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We were quite disappointed there. First waiter did not bring us any bread. And shrimps did not taste right for us.  Their fried oysters are good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... pâté and luke burger, 'nuff said.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Ziggy burger fabulous. Managers attitude sucks. Will not return due to her.\n",

      "But i did decide to stop in one day and grab the sweet potato fries i got the sriracha alioli with it and they're so addicting. Everyone gets the groothie, Im the \"im not eating grass ew type\" but thats my next try.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Salads-3; Groothie \"Green Smoothie\"-4. Sorry hip city Veg. Honey grow still has my heart.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We got the jerk chicken salad, portabel  burger, sweet potato fries, and the carrot ginger drink. The fries were really good but the rest was meh.  Expected more flavor from this place.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ordered a Family Pack and a Blondie brownie. A side of creamed spinach (apparently replaced by dried up of corn) and the brownie we're missing (disappointing). Delivery was on time, the meat and potatoes were good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The sauce and potato salad are good. It is over priced and they do not give generous portions.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We have had some mixed meals here lately. More actually , I think it's that the menu seems smaller. And it seems more expensive than my previous review.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The line is way too long here and the pancakes are overrated. The pancakes are okay but you then have to wait inside for food too. I got the blueberry stuff but it's just a pancake. I think going to dennys or ihops is preobbaly just the same man\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Got there early enough that the line wasn't too long. Food was okay, nothing special. I'd say go to The Row for breakfast/brunch, really liked it there. Won't be going back to Pancake Pantry nor would I recommend it to others.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Everything about this place is just normal, there is an extremely long line every day, and I don't know why. This is your basic breakfast food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Go to noshville. No need to wait 40 minutes at 1030 on a Thursday morning. Small portions.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Not worth the wait. Have to pay for parking. Go to Fidos just up the street.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nothing spectacular. Enjoyed the food but was expecting more after seeing all the reviews.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... we went pretty early on a sunday morning around 8am so we beat the crowd. by the time we left, the line was around the corner. the pancakes are pretty good but not worth the wait and sometimes distracted service.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Not the best pancakes I have ever had. Maybe I was just so hyped because they are suppose to be amazing- but they are ok. Line is not worth the wait.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good pancakes, but nothing special. Not worth going out of your way for.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was good and staff is nice but service is slow. This was my second time here and service was slow then also.  Brought out my husband's food fist with my side then 10 minutes my food came out.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... the breakfast buffet rocks. the service is pretty good. skip the dinner buffet.. really, skip tucson.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... chicken sandwich was a little light on the jam and spinach, good portion of chicken.  Roll was great.  But really, .50 for a little side of mayo when 7 of us are ordering sandwiches and drinks?\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Fries rebellion was a decent place to eat. Nothing super exciting. My boyfriend really liked the catfish sandwich. The interior decorations were really nice. I fed the stray cat in the parking lot on my way out :)\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The humorous waiter who performed the cooking style is the highlight of the Sushi Bar.!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Too pricey compare to the quality of sushis, but rolls are not so bad. 3.25 for 2pcs of sushi. 4 for cheap roll and 10 for more fancy rolls. Kinda fine if u do desperate jap food but if u have had experiences with 5stars sushi dont expect it to be the same here.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... They're half priced rolls are really not half priced... It's marketing. I've been to many places and the prices are somewhat the same. If your just going for simple rolls this place is not bad, however I have been to slightly better places such as Kyoto or even shin tori.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The service was good but the food was very mediocre. The chef over cooked the steaks. The fish tasted like tofu.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This is the only place in town that i know of that does it Hibachi style. My tip would be to go during the daytime for more affordable pricing. I always stick to the hibachi shrimp and chicken or scallops. I also love the fried rice!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This is basically a bennihana.  You get a decent amount of food and a \"show\".  Good for groups.  Can get busy on the weekends with tons of UCSBers doing sake bombs.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Meh. This place wouldn't make the cut in LA but I guess when you're pretty much the only ones doing Japanese in SB, there's nothing to compare it to.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Had the steak hibachi dinner, medium rare, and the meat was a little subpar. It was tough and chewy. Girlfriend had a philadelphia roll and said it was really good. Chef didn't talk much but we did have a large and talkative party.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Just okay. This place has a weird set up everything is out in the open. They have a good \"lunch box special\". The sushi itself is okay and the service is okay. Nothing too memorable.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I really wish there were more egg items on the menu. That's what I crave for breakfast. Half our Dutch baby pancakes and biscuit donut ball things were a bit burned and too crunchy. \n",
      "Overall the vibe is great and we had a fun birthday brunch but I wouldn't come here regularly.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I think people who aren't foodies are going to have a hard time enjoying this restaurant.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We visited on a Sunday morning.  While the food was unique and delicious, the noise level of the blaring music sucked the joy out of the experience for us.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I like the atmosphere in the restaurant. Decor blended the previous car repair shop well with the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was very tasty, however the portions are very small. $10 for a Belgian waffle that ended up being about 6\". I left hungry and had to go to a second restaurant after.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good food, but long long long wait.  I resent a chef takes pride in their menu, but not allowing any plate modifications is not my thing\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Was good and may try it again sometime.  I think my expectations were way to high based on advertised reputation.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Great environment and interesting choices on the menu. We met great people while sitting at the community table. However, very displeased with the barista and his demeanor. Very rude when bringing a drink and spilling it without apologizing.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Overrated breakfast option near downtown. We were impressed with neither the food nor the service. Will be passing this one.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The pastries were good, but the help was odd! \n",
      "You don't get a warm welcome, kinda feel the staff are under some form of Zomiefied\" attitudes! Lol! The prices are a bit much, but you pay for what you want! \n",
      "Idk if I'll be back????\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Overall, a good establishment. The food is different, yet good. The description could use a little work as I ordered chicken, which I do not recall it mentioning how hot/spicy it was. So hot that I consumed a grill cheese instead.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... My expectation was too high maybe after hearing how popular this place was. As for me, everything was too sweet for me.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Brunch is really good and I enjoy going, but the wait and the cost far exceed the quality.   Too many alternative choices for brunch, so I seldom go to MT unless it's convenient to where I'm at.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It was ok...only got to have tea and samples since line was SO long. We went on a Saturday morning. Be prepared for a very long wait. Gave 3 for great customer service.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Nice looking restaurant. The coffee shop is good. The menu is a bit eccentric and with only a few options and some were not breakfast options. Excessive wait times for breakfast!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It was okay. Not much in terms of style, quality or service. Pretty average Italian restaurant.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The service was mediocre at best. For example, our waitress tried to tell us a normal margarita is pink with strawberries in it. The restaurant was loud and the tables were too close. The food was good. Not bad, but nothing special either. I guess I just expected more based on the restaurants location.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The previous reviews were true. It was really loud and the service was not good. The food was ok, but overpriced. They had cloth tablecloths, but covered them in white paper which made they way less classy and my husband got a paper cut. Somehow it was still crowded.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Agree with the other comments that Brio's is not what it used to be since it was acquired.  Our dinner was good, but the portion sizes are now significantly smaller.  Management seemed disengaged.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... What happened to this place? The servings used to be huge-now they are barely a full meal. Prices don't reflect that. \n",
      "It is nice you can bring your own wine without a corkage fee. Be ready to pour it yourself-which isn't bad but just weird. \n",
      "Our server was nice but could have been more attentive.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The ambiance was amazing. The food was just okay. I also tried the spinach artichoke dip.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Had 2 out of 3 dishes excellent but chicken milanese was tasteless and tough. Generally have good meals and reason we return.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We had very good service.  The food was excellent, except for the salad.  The so called \"fresh tomatoes\" were pathetic.  They were pale and tasteless.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food looks beautiful but not a lot of taste. Good house Malbec $7.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not bad for typical Italian fare. Not to expensive considering it's in center city. Good taste, friendly, fast service. I would eat here again if fate brought me here, but I'm not going out of my way to get back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Great food. Ok service. Not greeted at door and got feeling like they were annoyed especially since we didn't have a reservation even though restaurant not even half full.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... LaScala's is the mainstay that my workgroup goes to for team lunches because it's close to the office and who doesn't like pizza? It's mediocre Italian food - an independent Olive Garden. It's clean, has seating that is good for large groups, and the service is friendly. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but it is convenient.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The portions and prices were very good .. The main entrees were tasty .. However we thought the service could have been more organized .. The server kept forgetting about us and we felt rushed .. Even for water we had to ask several times .. They totally forgot about the bread until we asked about it when the entrees came out ...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not anything special. Kind of expensive for the prices. Better Italian places in South Philly, but if you are looking for something to walk to, it works. The desserts were good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nice pizza, decent prices. Not mind-blowing, but under the Comcast Tower? It's good enough. Less than $7 for two decent sized slices. Lots of toppings and cheese.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Large portions. We ordered off the Restaurant Week menu. My friends meals were delicious. My gnocchi was over cooked. Waiter offered me a different dish, but I could not take leftovers to my next location that evening. Kinda bummed they didn't take some money off the bill.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was average, had pork chop and my wife had seafood fra diavolo.  Her fish tasted bad.  Appetizers and salad were good. Red sangria good.  Service was slow.  I would t recommend.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... BK's offers good Mexican food at a decent price. Try the Sonoran Dog or a caramelo, two of my favorites here. They also serve alcohol.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Sonora dog isn't as good as Calle Tepa, but their queso fondido was amazing. Mild green chilies and mushrooms come without additional charge. Very tasty.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... A bit over priced for Tucson and tacos. I don't like all the TVs and often inappropriate things playing with small children. Tacos are fine, service is fine, lots of choices in Tucson, so prefer other places.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We had the fish tacos and a veggie taco. Everything was ala carte  Small portions  but they were tasty. Seemed expensive for the portions. Nice salsa Bar.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... What better than corn beef hash and eggs in the wee hours of 6 in the morning. The coffee and meal were very good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Great prime rib, but as expected, overpriced. The service was very good. Atmosphere is a bit stuffy, but that wasn't a surprise. \n",
      "\n",
      "Value for money? No. \n",
      "\n",
      "High quality prime rib? Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worth $37 per cut? No.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We decided to have drinks at the bar which turned out to be very nicely made cosmos. Although the waiter came across a bit stuck up it was a nice restaurant to have drinks. We chose to eat elsewhere as the prices here are very high!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This seems like the unattractive sibling of Elaia. I tried several small plates. The flavors are good and chef is definitely experimenting but it doesn't leave its mark.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Best sloppy joe I've ever had. \"Turkish pizza\" or Lahmacun. Questionably. Everything else we had was food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This place is really nice and they have two small tables outside, which is nice. We ordered a latte and lox bagel sandwich. Latte was really good, but lox sandwich had two small pieces of smoked salmon and invaded by tomatoes, which is not the way it should be. Thats why 3 stars.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... If you like dark coffee and a decent place to work, this is your place.  The staff were not overly friendly and the place was a bit crowded.  It is older, and I appreciate that, but it is maintained.  The fake plans and bulletin boards were not tasteful.  I just did not enjoy the atmosphere, but was pleased with the ample seating and free wifi.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It ain't what it used to be! Hamburger was tastless, tofu taco had a blob of orange sauce did nothing to add flavorwise. Warmer inside than out and it was 86° outside! Our waitress was really good tho.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It was decent but hard to find good rolls that aren't fried, have cream cheese, or imitation crab.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Customer service was nice. The food was average. Our order was lukewarm, and the meat was dry. The meat also lacked flavor despite the teriyaki sauce it was covered in. I don't feel it was worth what we were charged for. I dont know if I will consider coming back again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was okay but service was not very good. We get in there about 9.30pm and they were all the time around clearly wanting us to eat and leave fast. The price a little bit expensive but miso soup was great and sushi was good too\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Sushi restaurant is decent. Fish is on the fresher side, but I would still stick with the rolls. A good selection of rolls, a decent selection of sake. Kind of the only option in Carpinteria.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Sushi was decent, but service absent.  Don't try the spicy edamame its flavorful, but not spicy.  The black tiger roll was delicious.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I tried this place and it was ok. I ordered the tips with mac and cheese and bake beans. Both the sides seem to taste store bought and my meat was a little tough. However, the workers were very friendly.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food is good but the service could be better.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you first walk in there is no hostess and no one to greet you. You basically sit down and wait for someone to notice you. In our case, it took nearly 20 minutes.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Pretty decent place for barbecue, it is a little loud but tolerable, it was a bit smaller than I expected so I felt a bit cramped especially having a small child with for dinner. Chicken was a bit dry but my sides were good\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was pretty average. The service needs a little work. It wasn't busy at all when we went in there. Everything seemed clean but I wasn't blown away by anything.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Pretty good coconut soup, pad Thai, and red curry. The Papaya salad came out without any papaya. On second glance the menu did say \"cabbage OR papaya\"--so I guess they gave us the cabbage version?\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Drunken Noodles and Red Curry w/Tofu were fine but my issue is with the take out system on a Friday night.  I was told 20 minutes but ended up waiting over an hour in the restaurant for my food.  I get they were busy, but they should have given more realistic time estimates.   Food was good, service was not.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ordered Veggie Fried Rice and Veggie Spring roll . Both tasted very average . Ambience was good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Reasonably priced spot with good beer and food selection. I tried the PO Boy with sauté onions and red peppers - food was good and the fries were great (note don't use ketchup as they are tasty by itself).\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The service was great & my food came in no time! \n",
      "I tried the taste of bayou & thought it was just okay. I'll give this place another try next time I'm around & get something different.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Just ok. You would think with a name like this, you would be about to get some authentic creole food in Nola. I had the gumbo and the crab claws. The gumbo wasn't hot and crab claws barely had any meat on them, but the taste of everything was good. Eh...I probably wouldn't go back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good food, loud atmosphere, great service by Ben. They were out of Bread Pudding, which was a big disappointment. The Alfredo was a bit overdone, nothing really outstanding about the food. Had it not been for the great service I'd have only given them one star.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Everything here was really bland, not deserving of the lofty 4+ stars it currently has. Good place to sample the various New Orleans centric dishes though\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I had the taste of the bayou. I liked the red beans and rice, but didn't care for the jambalaya or gumbo. The fried alligator was delicious.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Their food was just okay. Nothing spectacular, I'm sure you can find something better. Had the sampler, I would suggest not doing that if you do end up eating here. Also it took them over 25 minutes to bring out our oysters. How had is it to put some raw oysters on a plate?\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We ordered the Taste of the Bayou and the Boudin. The boudin was really good and I would do again. The Bayou was just alright. It came across as good enough for tourists. \n",
      "The service was great and the atmosphere quiet enough to talk but probably not quiet enough for those hard of hearing or elder.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food was delicious and our waitress was wonderful. However the platters were VERY small (all sauce, not much actual food). And THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SERVE ANY SHRIMP CREOLE which was incredibly disappointing. Other than that, our food was great and it came out shockingly fast. And warning: the prices are a little more than Yelp suggests!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Had a quick lunch here. Service was fast and pleasant. I had the roast beef PoBoy. It was like having 2 lbs of pot roast on a bun, very tasty.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Cute lil spot. We went to try the alligator.  It was breaded too much  and fried hard. I will have to try alligator somewhere else to determine if I like it.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The etouffe was very watery and bland. And the pasta was over cooked so the noodles were very soft...nothing like how a fettuccine noodle should taste like. We also ordered the shrimp ya-ya, which basically was only 5 pieces of tiny shrimp covered in pesto sauce...It was the most underwhelming meal I had in NOLA.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I had the grilled stuffed fish. The fish was very delicious with authentic stuffing. It was a little too salty. It came with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans which I thought were too plane\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The service was great, however the taste of food was mediocre; I'm comparing the taste of food to Acme and Oceana which are down the street. The portion of food was also small for the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... First restaurant I saw right outside the hotel.  Hostess was real nice and the service was decent.  The food (breakfast) wasn't all that great.  The eggs and potatoes were ok, however the bacon was burnt and the biscuit was like leather.  Over all ok place but wouldn't  eat breakfast there again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We ordered shrimp tats, fried alligator, oysters on half shell, Taste of Bayou (4) and fish platter. The food was good, particularly loved the shrimp yaya.\n",
      "But the wait was long. There were many available tables but the kitchen was too back up. So they would not seat anyone.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was good but service not so much! She was Not around most the time and was sitting behind the station but gave me attitude when I was trying to get her attention saying she was all over the restaurant when indeed was not!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I took two bites of my crab cake and each bite was FILLED with shells. The pieces were quite large so I'm not sure how they were missed to be honest. It was so off putting that I didn't take another bite. The Alfredo was good, so I just focused my attention to that.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The pick 3 satisfied my creole craving. The shrimp and grits was good, but heavy on the butter and cheese.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I had the prime rib ppeparedd wonderfully. We all Jago had the oysters that my husband said were okay a little heavy on the horseradish though\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Meh....overpriced and gave us the runs. It's was good but....they wouldn't let our 5th friend who showed up later sit at our four-person table. A bit of a touristy spot.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... My food was cold, grilled Oyster cold not and not done. I had a Voodoo Doll drink  something swimming in there. My husband food and my friends was OK bread very hard\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Oysters were so good. Jambalaya pasta needs more salt and spice. Maybe even garlic. I would reorder the oysters in a heart beat!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Touristy-Diner... Not impressive, would skip this place with all the other options in the area. The only reason for the 3 stars as opposed to 2 is that the service was excellent. Food is just average at best and after a week in NOLA, average food is just not acceptable.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was average and did take a bit to come out Service was good.\n",
      "Great local beer selection.  Had Chimichanga and burger and fries both were average but not outstanding. Great space/ bar.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Chose Tavern because I wanted to catch a baseball game on their TVs while eating.  The wait for a table of four was an hour on a Saturday night.  Food was fine but nothing to jump up and down about.  Waitress recommended the Tavern burger...it was ok.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Loud atmosphere. Menu is confusing as hell some weird shit on the menu. But the burger and tavern fries are good. Excellent service\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I went here with my boyfriend and I thought my meal was decent but overpriced. The atmosphere is okay... I would recommend this place to a group of guys and gals that are single... Not really a date night place or a family place.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was a mixed bag.  My wife order the tacos and I ordered the chicken kebobs.  My wife's were good and mine were so-so.  The prices is what makes them 2-3 stars.  Drinks saved them from 2 stars.  Food quality does not warrant the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Writing just to remember this place since the name is so creative. I was surprised by Tavern since its located so close to dive bars such as Losers, Winners, etc. Didn't eat here, but it's worth checking out for drinks in a more upscale Vanderbilt area bar.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Tavern never dissapoints for brunch but thought I'd try out dinner this week. 2 for 1 drinks on Wednesday was a good deal. The food on the other hand was underwhelming. Ordered grilled chicken skewers, they came out chewy and I was not satisfied.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Appreciated the timely and friendly service! The buffalo cauliflower is good (but I can make it just as good) and the nachos were just okay. Not my first choice but I would go back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... This review is based on the drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were mediocre at best. The establishment looks very nice and it is clean but the drinks are not up to par\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... A lot of hype.   Cocktails were good. Food was ok and basically overpriced.   Nice break from the downtown madness. Not a drunk cowboy hat to be found anywhere\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The 2-4-1 beer selection on Wednesday's is straight up garbage. The service was a 5. I had the blackened fish tacos which were just okay. My wife had chicken skewers that were over cooked or sat under the heat lamp to long. Atmosphere was nice but maybe a bit loud for some folks. I'd go again for sure.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I would stick to what you know when going here. It's not a place I would try something different because it looks interesting. Got curious and ordered duck wings and it was awful. It's an ok place to have something to eat and a drink before going out for the night.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was a mixed bag. I had the kale salad which was good.  I also had the short rib tacos and they were very disappointing.  I know this place has good reviews so maybe they were having an off night.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Chickarrones, NOT Chicken Skin, just popcorn chicken with some soft skin attached to it covered in that Chinese sweet chili sauce. I was expecting Crispy fried chicken skin based on the name and the other photos of fried chicken skin from previous guests.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... Had VERY slow service (over an hour) before finally saying let's go somewhere else,,, Manager comped drinks,,, GREAT MOVE on her part. We'll be back to try again\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The cafe has very good food. Near-perfect calamari fritti, and nice pastas. I'm not a huge fan of the waitstaff.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was delicious. Waiter was not very nice. We seemed to bother him. He could be a little friendlier.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The Italy food restaurant is close to Delaware River. The waiters are enthusiastic, and the food is okay.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ok this is not In-N-Out burger,  but an occasional alternative. I find the taste of their burgers to only be average. They remind me of a whopper at Burger King. Their fries are not very tasty, although the onion rings are good. \n",
      "I have co workers who rave about this place. I just don't see it.  It is not bad but not special either.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I like that they offer chili dogs and chili burgers at this location, but I just wished it tasted better. Other than that, no different from the other locations, but this one is without the benefit of good State Street people watching.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Ordered the cobb salad and this time they forgot the bacon and blue cheese.  I will now admit, salads are definitely not one of their specialties.  Go elsewhere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Every time you go here for a breakfast sandwich they are sold out for everything and your waiting 20 minutes\n",
      "You would think that efficiency would be involved in the equation.   Nope.\n",
      "Its the same thing EVERY time.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Very good food but SMALL portions.  Like...really really small.   The seating is also very uncomfortable- both outdoor & indoor are cheap metal chairs.   \n",
      "They've got a good thing going in the kitchen but the portions should be doubled... then I'd give 5 stars.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The outdoor seating here is very cute, part covered and part in the sun. The inside was nice and you can tell it's definitely a different place not during COVID. We tried two of the breakfast toasts and they were good, but a bit too sweet. Unfortunately the coffee tasted burnt and it was difficult to get down.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Really not sure what the hype was when it opened. It's fine, the ambiance was nice, but the menu is limited and food is nothing to write home about. They are in a nice location so at least if you decide to wait, then you have things to see...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The service was very good and our food came out pretty quickly. The food was just so-so though. My grain salad (Farro?) has crunchy bits like it was undercooked or left out to harden. My husband has the chicken and said it was dry. Honestly not a terrible meal, but at $17 a plate it was not worth the price.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The atmosphere was great but the service was subpar. There were a lot of open tables in the middle of the restaurant but they put us in the corner against a wall. They were out of the tea I wanted and the tea was supposed to be loose leaf but it was in a teabag. Food was ok, nothing to write home about.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Went for early breakfast and food was good, but not overwhelming in quantity. Service was slow and took 10 minutes for refill on coffee which btw was an additional 75 cents on top of $3 for the first cup. Probably won't be back anytime soon.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was hit or miss. I really liked the biscuit, but not enough that it was worth the wait. They were also out of quite a bit the day we went. First 4 things (juices/food) I ordered were not available.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Homemade everything. Better than your momma's food?...maybe, maybe not. The portion sizes are nice though.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... We had group of 9 for Sunday breakfast. They accommodated a reservation and service was really good all around. Food was average (cold eggs, fruit over ripe, bacon over cooked) and coffee refills are not free thus being overpriced.  Just ok overall.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... the food was good but the service was ROUGH! if you chose to dine here make sure you have plenty of time to spare!!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Something about this place made it better than just okay. The menu was fine. The food was fine. The service was fine. It was just all around fine. Sorry but that's all I got.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I got the matcha iced latte but it sucked. The only reason for the 3 stars is my gf liked her Nutella drink and pastries were good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not much to write about. It was clean had a nice atmosphere but the food was average diner  experience to me.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Had a lunch at M&H recently and was a bit disappointed. Food and service were so-so at best. Will give it a try for dinner, but I am concerned this may be a tourist place that locals who know better avoid.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I wasn't that impressed with the food here. It was good but mediocre. The ambience is nice but be prepared to wait\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Long wait, staff friendly, no alcohol until after 10 am, food was OK nothing fantastical and we sat at the bar and would definitely not have waited 40 min for a table.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The wait for our table was only 30 min but, it took 45 min from when we ordered to get our food.  The food was cold and not the best.  They do have delicious coffee at their coffee bar! The milk & honey latte was great! I won't be back to eat but would stop in for a latte.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Party of 3. They sat us immediately!  Plus. Server is very nice and came with water and lemons. Plus. The biscuits and waffle were dry\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Yummy iced coffee and good cinnamon roll here. We couldn't eat breakfast here though at a table because the wait was 1.5-2 hours for a group of 6 on a Friday morning.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The biscuits were good. However everything else was okay. Definitely gets a higher review than worth. Our server wasn't great and the bathrooms were filthy.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Started with sketchy service (waited one 1/2 hour after order placed before management recognized a problem present, once aware quickly resolved). However, food was very good - fresh, tasty and reasonably priced (for location). \n",
      "I will definitely go back\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... We had the chicken and waffles and also shared the farmhouse biscuit. Everything was really good especially with the honey hot sauce! However within 20 minutes we had to go to the bathroom reaaaal bad. Yikes.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Got sausage and pepper omelet and the big kids meal (scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries and biscuit). I truly wish the rest of the meal stacked up to the biscuit and honey (which were PERFECTION). A bit overpriced for portions provided.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Don't forget your mask! Such a joke! Ordered the rosemary honey drink and it was good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food is pretty good but a little pricey I have been there several times and the service is so so and the food is not consistently good. I had a time when the food was delicious and a time when it wasn't so great.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I think most of the food was pretty good for an outside-of-Vegas buffet. However, their selection was very limited. You can try everything that looks appealing in about 2 plates. I did like the pistacio gelato. The price was reasonable, but not noteworthy.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Tip number one: if you see a bus or 2 run or else you will be in for a long wait for one \"famous lobster\". Also, I just appreciate more of Jackson Rancherias lobster buffet, better selections and service.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... This buffet is ok. $18 per person isn't too bad. I wouldn't mind coming back. Lots of different foods to choose from.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Cheap and worth the price. I will however recommend the stir fry bar.  The variety and spread of a Circus Circus meal\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It was OK. Seriously not worth the long wait. \n",
      "A lot of food so if you're really hungry then go for it, otherwise I'm sure Reno has better to offer.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The fried chicken was dry. It should have been replaced hours ago. The sausage with onions and bell peppers rocked! The crepe lady is a must-go-to. She made the most beautiful blueberry whip cream crepe Ive ever seem. People ooohed as I walked by carrying it back to my table.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Expensive mediocre buffet the only positive for us was the gelato. It was divine ! We won't go back and I wouldn't recommend it unless you can eat lots of gelato but the smoke was overpowering\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Called in for the breakfast buffet this morning and was somewhat disappointed. I can't eat eggs and this left me with very little to choose from. I was surprised by the lack of variety with the food and its very ordinary  presentation.  With so many good buffets around I was expecting this to be a lot better than what it was.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The Buffet - not exactly the most clever name for a casino buffet... or is it? Anyway, the food here was fine - just what you can get from most buffets around the gambling world. However, one thing made it stand out above the others and that was the multiple flavors of gelato for dessert. I would come back just for that over and over again.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It is nice that they finally give a locals discount. The food has gotten better over the years,  however,  someone needs to take the salt shaker away from the cooks.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... DO NOT get the shrimp and grits on the brunch menu.  It was tasteless and watery. I dumped an entire cup of hot sauce in it just to add some flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend ordered the frittata, which was made pretty decently, so if you must go there for brunch, stick to that instead.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Only went for SIPS and apps--disclaimer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watermelon sangria is worth ordering, probably the best drink on their menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truffle popcorn was decent as was the calamari and lemon hummus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come for the watermelon sangria!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Very nice coffee. Wonderful breakfast burrito that was ruined by over cooking.   Interezting place.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Mr.B's has seen better days. Service is lacking (we reordered bread and never received it, Wine was brought to the table well into the main course, my soup was almost cold).\n",
      "The food is still good, but they really need to work on getting the service to the level it used to be.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was reaaaally good - but they waits forgot to bring me something to clean my hands when i ordered shrimps.... Thats a no go.... Especially for a place rated that high.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food was alright, certainly not one of our better dinners on the trip. The filet was dry and poorly seasoned. The sides were not great either. I do like the fresh baked bread that they bring to the table and the service was great. If you're looking for a steak, try someplace else\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... A little stuffy for my taste but the food was decent. Great gumbo. BBQ shrimp were amazing as were my shrimp and grits. Bread pudding was cold which kind of pissed me off. We had no reservation and only waited 20 minutes.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nothing really remarkable here. The service is good, the food is good. There are much better restaurants around, but if you want something kind of corporate with a big table, they can probably accommodate that. I wouldn't come here for any special occasions or personally...just not worth it and the food is unexceptional.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Kudos to mr b's for the 1-1-1 combos. More places should offer this. It gives you an opportunity to try more menu items. The oyster and the shrimp apps were fantastic. Good service. Some people rave over the bbq shrimp but I thought it was just whatever.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Sadly not the best. Mediocre. But good advertisement I have to admit. 5 star for that but this is food review site.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Recommended by my realtor, who is a New Orleans native. The service was great, but the food was over-rated.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Waaaaaay too pricey for the quality. Service was really good though, although some orders were taking a bit too long comparatively. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu was lacking the local, NOLA faire. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not exactly sure what makes this such a tourist staple aside from the location.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Gumbo Ya-Ya pretty thin.  Yellowfin tuna boring--has lost the pizzazz it had ten years ago.  Surviving on its name.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good food, good service. Priced reasonably.\n",
      "Try the pork chops!\n",
      "Crab cakes were cold\n",
      "Truffle fries on point\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Ordered seafood gumbo as an appetizer and gulf shrimp wrapped in bacon with grits as entree. The gumbo was subpar. Good base flavor, but all I got was the base and one small piece of shrimp. No other chunks whatsoever! Entree and fresh bread were good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Been here many times and my most recent was average.  Grilled redfish was a little fishy.  Co-worker had a filet and said it was the best he has had.  Should have stuck with my usual BBQ shrimp!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I'm giving only 3 stars because I felt the food was way overpriced for what we ordered. Nice atmosphere and the jazz brunch band was a nice touch, but too much money for their omelette/egg dishes.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... nice food but really slow service. we even had an early reservation but the wait staff was just not on the ball. recommend the soft shell crab\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Adequate but not great service, disappointing wine list. Right-sized portions, clean and an avoidance of overreliance on butter and salt, allowing the flavors of the food to be the star. Overall, ok, but didn't blow me away.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... It's ok \n",
      "I had grilled red fish - blood line on fish not cleaned well\n",
      "My husband had same fish but blackened- must better. \n",
      "Loud (in non reservation area). \n",
      "Single ck for us\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... tried out the BBQ shrimp b/c my friend recommended it. flavor was pretty good, but i still prefer boiling crab here in southern california.\n",
      "\n",
      "if we visit NOLA again, we might come back to try other items on the menu\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Quality has fallen, making this a \"once was\" favorite.  Bar staff is still strong, but restaurant servers, menu selection and food quality are not up to many other, less expensive, nearby competitors. Drink here, eat elsewhere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... This time around, the service and the ambiance was still great, however the food not so much. The Snapper dish was very dry and the shrimp & grits was overpowered by the bacon wrapped around the shrimp. We would still go back and try something else.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This restaurant came highly recommended by coworkers at NASA.  The service was second to none.  We did find the menu pricey.  But the dinner was perfectly cooked.  The location is in the New Orleans French Quarters.  Parking is difficult if your driving\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Roux in the gumbo was burnt. Too much butter in the BBQ shrimp that overwhelmed all the other flavors. Parmesan would have been better on the truffle fries, the few strands of pecorino added decoration more than flavor.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The gumbo yaya everyone recommends was lukewarm, preferred it hot, the way soup should be. \n",
      "The shrimp bbq was very hard to peel and messy. Tasted okay -- I prefer Emeril's BBQ shrimp better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices are too high for the quality of food served.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Great old school atmosphere, decent food at fancy prices. You can get just as good executions of NOLA food classics at other places for a bit cheaper but that probably isn't the point!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Beignets are very good but I still prefer Cafe du monde! This place had very few places to sit\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Fairly good beignets. Awful breakfast otherwise. Adequate service. Three stars only because they good live music running all day long.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Music and food mid day is hard to find, this is a good option. Definitely drink beef or the coffe from the cafe as the drinks from the other place in the plaza are iffy (pre mixed in a voodoo vat)\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The food was OK. I wasn't feeling that I had to go to the register to order lunch. It's a tourist trap establishment that because its on bourbon street with a lot of foot traffic it gets a lot of business but I've definitely had better in NO. I wouldn't be going back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I didn't know that this restaurant only had outdoor seating. I visited after some rain and I wasn't in the mood to sit on hard, wet seats and eat amongst cigarette smoke, so I did take-away. The red beans and rice and praline that I ordered was average and the music was excellent.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Donuts and frozen café au lait are delicious.  Service is like molasses and we almost missed our trolley because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, you gotta go there at least once.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The live music performers were great. We had the beignets which are made fresh and they were delicious. I also had a shrimp po boy and it was just average and bland. I would come here again but only for the beignets and the live music.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Crawfish omelet was ok beignets well let me put it to you this way. To a Northerner or Yankee like myself a beignet is nothing more than fried dough with too much powdered sugar on it. \n",
      "  Hey if for nothing else go here for the music.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good breakfast. Andouille sausage omelet was good, and beignets were tasty. The prices seemed reasonable for Bourbon St, but the portions are fairly small for the money. Wasn't a fan of the coffee also...not sure why but it had a weird spice flavor. Otherwise, not bad.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Went here while taking a break from the crazy Bourbon St crowd.  Live music was great and it was a nice little niche.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beignets we got here weren't as good as others that I had while in New Orleans.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Small place \n",
      "Only a few tables\n",
      "Birds flying in and out of the restaurant \n",
      "Beignets were okay \n",
      "Cafe au lait were good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I came here during the afternoon when bourbon wasn't quite as rowdy. There was a live band playing which was nice and pleasant. I tried a poboy and some jambalaya with French fries. I didn't care for the jambalaya, but I'd probably give this place another try.  Cool atmosphere too\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Although it's a nice atmosphere and the music is wonderful, the food isn't great. It's over priced and not really worth it. However if you just want a drink from the bar and listen to music it is alright.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Dripping with tourists, seemingly mostly from England today, but enjoyable due to live jazz (all 3 stars are for the music).  Beignets here felt like giant square elephant ears and not so special.  Cafe au lait was mostly lait.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Beignet was under cook and margarita was water down. Service and live music made up for good atmosphere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Live music at night was fantastic and overall great vibes. The food, however, subpar. We got the shrimp po boy which was rather dry and bland. You should also be prepared to pay for a cup of tap water.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Great courtyard to sit and grab a bite. You have to order at the window and then they bring the food to you. Other than that, no service at all. The roast beef sandwich was decent but the mufaletta was underwhelming. The band however was very good\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Enjoy a cocktail to the sound of a live band. \n",
      "This place is a little hidden from the street, which makes it more quiet from the noise and parties going on, on bourbon street.\n",
      "Their cocktails are expensive and coming from an \"already made\" machine... you are really paying for the place and the live music.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... there was a line. had to sign in with name and number. had to order food to order a daiquiri. then you couldn't leave with any drinks. we orders beignets and an iced coffee. pretty fast service and nice scenery and sitting area. had a live band playing good music. but I wouldn't return.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Very commercial. The food is only okay. The ambiance is nice tho. They had a live band and you can people watch everyone on bourbon street if you like\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Had breakfast here once during our one-week stay. Perhaps we just weren't the biggest fan of beignets to begin with, but overall, I think there are better breakfast places in the city. \n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing going for this location is the live music which goes into the late night hours as well.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Went to try these out in relation to Cafe du Monde. There was a bit of a line, so my friend and I waited 20-30 minutes. The space is decently nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the beignets were much denser than Cafe du Monde - so there was no contest for me. Everything else looked mediocre as well.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... First beignet of the trip. Sadly, it was just okay. Thick batter with an abundance of powdered sugar. WAY too much in my opinion. I wish I asked for it on the side so I could add my own amount. I liked how they were cooked to order though, so they were really fresh. Other than that, I was not too impressed.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Tried the fresh handmade beignets, jambalaya, praline, and the Belgian waffles. The waffles and the jambalaya were pretty good. The beignets were okay, but I didn't care for the texture.  It was thick and dense.  The praline was also okay.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... After going to Cafe De Monde the day before, we tried cafe beignet. It gets really crowded early on in the day and the place was very cramped. We ordered beignets, white chocolate au lait and a coffee. Beignets were alright and the coffee wasn't bad.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I went here with some friends and I would recommend this place for some great drinks. They have some unique cocktails and cordials. But I was disappointed in the food.  It was just bland and nothing exciting.  The service was pleasant but it didn't make the food any better. Come here if you're looking for a variety of booze but don't come hungry.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good Drinks I found burgers to be over priced and every thing was a add on they also came with no french fries and started at 12 dollars. Duck  fries were very good and their service is exceptional. I will skip the burger next time not worth the high price\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Love the burger but overpriced. Duck fat French fries is recommended.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Don't even think about going here Thurs-Sat.  There's a total of 17 seats (including the one in the commode), and people tend to linger over their cocktails.  Service is great, booze is top-notch, and food is a B+.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Delicious puck-shaped burgers! This famous spot is fun to try, however for the high price point and difficulty getting a seat (especially since they don't take reservations), I probably won't be coming here again anytime soon\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... $60 (including tip) for 2 burgers and 2 beers. Need I say more? Burgers were good and meaty but won't be craving them with that price tag. Did not have whiskey while there-- maybe that would have turned it up a notch for me. Just overall feel there are tons of good burgers in the city and this was not hitting the mark for me.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I was kinda bummed because everyone raves about their burgers, and I was pumped to get my chops on one of those succulent burgers. But, I just didn't feel it. Maybe it's a combination of alcohol that makes them notoriously amazing and I was just too sober.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Not sure what all the fuss is about...wait is too long to justify the burger, which I found to be just okay; been here a few times, friend's choice, not mine. Would rather skip the wait and head over to Devi's Alley - burger with bleu cheese and bacon scrumptious!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Bartender was great, the bar food was good, the hostess was very rude.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... First time visit on Friday. Service was very good. My guest had a wonderful omlett and really enjoyed it. I had the classic eggs Benedict. It was ok but I would recommend they  serve the English muffin much softer. Mine was hard to cut and chew.  Atmosphere was very nice.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Enjoyed a solid brunch here Saturday.  Has both indoor and outdoor seating.  The food is excellent, the menu is creative, the service was good, but the prices are a little steep - hence 3 rating...\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was great just wasn't hot when it came out. It was lukewarm.  Portions were nice loved the Belgium Waffle\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good food, considerable wait time. Very nice staff however, very slow service. Loved the French toast, and nice to have breakfast and lunch available all day. It's a very busy restaurant so I'd recommend arriving earlier.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food is good, interior is a bore. Waitress was sweet. I like this place. The food is always hot and fresh. Delicious naans\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food here is very good. We always get take out, and have yet to not enjoy a meal. Why the 3 stars?? Okay, there is never a lot of meat in their dishes and sometimes the sauces are a little to oily. Besides that, I think this is one of the best for this type of food in the area.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The staff is nice and the food comes out quick,   Good fare but nothing you can't get somewhere else.   Take your parents here, very conservative recipes.   Good as far as BYOB's go?\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Party of eight. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Large selection of craft beers. I would rate better but our waitress was terrible. Half of our orders were incorrect. She would also disappear for long periods of time. Definitely recommend but hope you get different waitress.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The pricing is great, and the sushi is alright. Unless you buy the expensive rolls, the sushi is just alright. Since it is so cheap, it is worth it. Nice employees and cooks\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Visited this place while at a weekend in SB. I thought it would be comparable to Benihana and my friend recommended it.\n",
      "However, everything was mediocre. The food wasn't bad but nothing really made me say woah. \n",
      "The sushi was better than the actual hibachi style entrees.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Excellent if you're in college and want to have a fun drunken evening w/ your friends, sake-bombing at a place just like Benihana's....not so great if you plan on taking your parents there! Noisy, and not the best environment for families:)\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This restaurant is okay, and considering it's the only Hibachi place in town we keep ending up there... but I've been to much better.  Wish we had more options in SB.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Cheap, fun atmosphere, subpar service, and loud people taking saki bombs. Good place to go if your looking for decent food and a relatively low bill. Embrace the rest.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This place place used to be great. The ginger is too warm for taste and enjoyment. I probably will still come back for the prices. Never gotten sick. Always moderately fresh and enjoyable.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Food was delicious and in their defense it was cold the day we went, they had heaters that didn't really work and my food got cold before I even finish. Sushi was ok, the ambiance is great because it's outside and you can see all the people. We didn't get the dipping sauces for the dish.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Seating and service were fine. Prices were fine, but not much of a \"bang for your buck\". We weren't too hungry, so it wasn't a big deal, but the sushi rolls were itty bitty. They tasted great, but just wasn't the quantity we were hoping for.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nice location and good service. Food was average - steak was a little fatty but the fried rice and vegetables were very good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Very foodie spot. The staff is beyond nice and lovely. The downside to Milktooth is they will make zero adaptations or substitutions to items on their menu, which makes it very difficult if you have special dietary needs. I think they could spare to be a bit more flexible and customer centered!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Very hippie as I do agree with a previous yelper. I thought I was hippiedom until I came here lol. Chaotic lines on weekends that have no rhyme or reason. I will say that the free glass of wine in the am was great so thanks staff (you know who you are).\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Good, but overrated and overpriced. The unusual menu items are worth going once for novelty, but the portions and taste do not meet the price. Great atmosphere. Chairs could be more comfy.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... It was busy and I think service could be better. The server didn't introduce herself and the menu is limited. The waffles were soaked in syrup and it was too sweet. Nice decoration.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Unique brunch items wit a hippy feel.  Staff were very friendly and food was tasty.  The original baby Dutch pancake with ham was delicious and huge!  Exceeded my expectations!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Cool vibes at Milktooth! Every cup of coffee is freshly made in front of you. We didn't have enough time to enjoy a meal here, but I hope to be back one day!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nothing here, folks, keep moving.  Food was ok but certainly not up to the hype.  Friendly and helpful server was the salvation.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Stopped by here before my flight out of Indy because of the eclectic menu they had online. I had a glass of fresh OJ and the fresh berry Dutch baby. The service was quick and the place has a very fun vibe. They were closing about 30 minutes after I was done eating and were definitely more interested in cleaning up than taking care of their customers.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Definite hipster vibe. They have Dutch baby pancakes which are absolutely awesome, but just add one too many ingredients that seems to throw the flavors off. Overall a fairly nice place, but better breakfast can be found elsewhere.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I got invited here, and although it was not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to go again.  It definitely feels like a chain restaurant - bland atmosphere, OK food.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... I was clear that I could not have dairy and the waitress assured us that the meal did not have dairy. When the food arrived the pasta clearly\n",
      "Had fettuccine sauce and then the waitress argued with us about it. Luckily the manager was able to fix it and we got a new waitress.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... We went to Brio because of an e-mail we received about happy hour at the bar or on the terrace.  We sat on the terrace and were told no happy hour because they were short of help.  However, we were served on the terrace so they had enough help to serve at regular prices.  Very poor customer relations.\n",
      "Susie E.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Generally good food. Nice patio. Used to love their chopped salad but the lettuce, which used to be quite crisp, has been limp the last three times I have been there, like it had been sitting in dressing at room temperature for a few hours.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... If you are looking for a good pizza, this is the place. The kicken runs a bit slow, but its pizza pies and seafood pasta were pretty good. Not so much of unique..or special..  Service if ok, too.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nope. Nope. Nope. The dessert was alright...I had the bread pudding. Just got spaghetti and meatballs. Simple dish..yet they didn't do it right. Oh well. Caveat..I am not much of an Italian food fan unless its really really really good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Okay. Not GREAT. food was fine. Nothing special or particularly outstanding. It was good. Service was pretty solid. Tiramisu was sour?  Not sure why. Didn't finish it. It's silly that this is not a long enough review\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chose calamari as an app and a small chicken wing stromboli as my meal.  Definitely is enough for two ppl. \n",
      "\n",
      "Woman's bathroom is VERY nice and clean.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This establishment was a nice night out for dinner.  The menu is not very extensive and the food is slightly above average and somewhat pricy for what you get  but the atmosphere and the service are excellent.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... If you order the pasta dishes, be prepared to wait. I waited a good 25 minutes for my order while every who ordered after me get their pizza and sandwiches get theirs first. I have to ask for it before somebody starts making it. Pasta was too al dente, the sauce was good though, I'll give them that.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Went to La Scala on work mates suggestion to celebrate our 30th anniversary. Restaurant decor is lovely and there are tables outside. Food was fine however our server was not very attentive. Tables around us were receiving better service so maybe our server was having an off night?\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Good meal for the price.  You get plenty of food and was pleasantly surprised by the portions of seafood  in the pasta.  I recommend this restaurant.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Portions here are big.  Above average Italian and some pretty good pizza.  Service is hit or miss, and décor is just ok.  It has a bar and the place does good business.  Nice restaurant.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I was greeted by the manager at the door with, \"What can I do for ya, Buddy?\" When I told him I was there to eat, he seemed displeased with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stuffed long-hots were great. The veal Marsala was good. The espresso was good too. My server was polite and efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over all, it was an unfortunate experience.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Been going here for years, loved the food in the past. Ate chicken parm and pasta lunch 2 months ago- bland. Went this week for restaurant week; salmon/potato entree-just ok. Seems like there is a new chef. Food not as flavorful as in the past.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... The atmosphere is nice , service was very good  but the food had a lot to be desired.  Salad was wet, pizza was so dry I could not eat it. , pasta was on level of Olive Garden. My friend ordered ravioli and she was disappointed ( it was the special too)   There are so many great restaurants in Philly so I would not put this on my list !\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... it was just ok kind of slow on service when there wasn't to many people there. Plus side a free refill on horchata and had good different condiments\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I went here for dinner last week and got 3 tacos. The portion size was good. The chicken was just ok. The carne asada was better. They have a salsa and topping bar to add to your tacos. It's hard to tell what everything is though. They should label the toppings.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Very fast servers, with a great attitude, the al Pastor tacos are \"truly\" al Pastor tacos :) very happy to have some in Tucson.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... had the carne asada burro and the sonoran hot dog.  I'm sorry for the judges in the food wars show, but, although this is pretty good, Guero Canelo has it beat by a longshot in my tastebud's opinion.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: negative ....... The ham torta was good.  We also had a fish taco that tasted like frozen fish sticks on a tortilla.  We also had the carne asado and I thought it was fatty and bland.  I won't be going back.  On the plus side the salsa bar was a winner.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Mediocre is the best way to describe this place. The service was good and the atmosphere was OK. The menu is inadequate (no rice, refried beans, garnish in or on the burritos). The food is bare-bones and not particularly flavorful. There are better options in the same price category. We will not return.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This place is good. For the lofty prices the proportions were very small. However the drinks were cheap and the service was very good. The piano is a nice touch as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cheesecake is incredible, just get it and don't look back.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... I thought the food was really good . I think the place ia a little stuffy though . The bartenders are wearing tuxedos and the waiter or table captain as they put it was wearing a suit . I have to say that our table captain who's name was Jimmy was not a very good waiter at all !!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Great ambiance. Piano player is a nice touch. As for the steak, it was fair at best....tough with little flavor. The side dishes were very small portions for the price. The Prime Rib has slipped.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Food is very tasty. Service was slow but accurate. Outdoor dining cute but a little shabby. Chair sank in the gravel. A bit pricey for the whole package but a pleasant experience.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The place is was good. The hot chocolate wasn't too sweet and just right for me. It was pretty loud with all the college students, but very relaxing and was able to spend quality time with my girl friend.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Surprisingly spacious. Friendly barista. I was impressed with their \"condiments\" bar - whole/skim/soy milk, half and half, honey, the usual array of sugar choices, and...agave nectar?! Wow.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Elmers great.  Cookie dessert, oh my.  Friendly bartenders who are often airing their woes behind the bar.  \n",
      "Burgers were good.   \n",
      "I would visit again, just not first choice.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Great attentive service and if you're going as a family I recommend it. But if you're going with friends it's not as fun for the younger crowd. The pretzel was good, but nothing to write home about.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... All I've had here was a glass of wine at an after-work happy hour, but I can say that it was lovely to sit outside on the patio, and the wine was pretty good.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Reasonable service. Beers are decent. Took a bit to get our check but the waitstaff were kind and helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd return if I was looking for a beer/meal during the day but I get the feeling service slows down after lunch.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Nice Decor, reasonably priced, convenient location, nice interior. Needs bigger TV. Girl at bar was very friendly and greeted us when we came in. Our waitress, however, was pushy and abrupt. Needs to be more patient with first time customers who have questions about the menu.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The bartender was an awesome guy. I forgot is name but he made the time there more enjoyable with conversation and knowledge of the beers. The tenderloin was quite dry and the fries were subpar. Great place for social drinks!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Stopped in for dinner while visiting family in the area. Ordered Chirashi and while the presentation was nice and the cuts of fish were decent, the actual quality of the fish was average at best. The table was a bit sticky as well, which was offputting. Upswing: positive and polite workers.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Has been better of late. Seems like there is someone running a tighter ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope they keep doing what their doing and improving.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Love that there are fun restaurants in Speedway now. This has a great atmosphere. Exactly what you would expect from a BBQ restaurant. The food is pretty good. Not great BBQ, but we would go back if we are looking for a bbq place that is close to home.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This is my first time here. Nice lunch atmosphere. Had the beef brisket sandwich. It was very good. Came with a side of chips. That could have been better.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The meal started great.  Pork rinds and the corn dip were great!  Good selection of bourbons.  Brisket was a train wreck.  Super dry no flavor.. pulled chicken was also dry.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Solid Thai food. Intimate dining room. Good service. Very dependable. Easy parking. Good lunch special.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... The food is amazing!  The atmosphere has improved with the new ownership but the service is extremely slow. Luckily the yummy food makes you forget the long wait. The hostess/owner is very nice however easily distracted.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... I want to love milktooth... maybe I'm missing something? I find it to be overrated. It's a fun place to take friends from out of town for some different fare. Their coffee drinks are super yummy!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... This place and I just didn't click. It was a cute atmosphere and the coffee was great. I was told I should have tried the pastries so I must have missed out. The service was great and I always enjoy a good community table. Our food was ok.\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: neutral ....... Uh it was ok. We got here late so I'll make an exception. But due to the price I expected better honestly. The wait staff was not as attentive as I thought they should be. But the food was pretty good! And I LOVED the ambiance!\n",
      "Sentiment prediction for sample text: positive ....... Went for the prix fixe menu... I was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and the service was great. Very nice atmosphere. A bit (a lot) pretentious. At my age, this isn't your once a week, or even once a month place. I would return for a special occasion or for the prix fixe menu.\n"
